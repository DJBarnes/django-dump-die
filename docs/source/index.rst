Welcome to Django-Dump-Die's documentation!
*******************************************

Django-Dump-Die is a `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ app that
provides a couple of debug tools in the form of built-in methods
``dump`` and ``dd`` that allow you to send details about a variable to the
browser for inspection. Dumped variables are presented in an easy to read and
fully expandable / collapsible tree. You can easily understand complex objects
and the results of django queries with a simple call to either method.
The entire concept is heavily based on the dump die functionality that comes
with Laravel and Symfony.
